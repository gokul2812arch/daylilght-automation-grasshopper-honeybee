Complete automation of daylight simulation - from geometry generation to report generation

Features of this tool :

- Automated Geometry Generation from just Polylines
- Interactive dashboard for Intuitive layman usage
- Most accurate and automated sky file generation for simulation
- Instant result visualization integrated with geometry
- Automated Report Generation for LEED v4 compliance
- Compliance Modelling 5x Faster

This tool has been developed to augment the efficiency and speed of the daylight compliance
Modeling workflow and inculcate automation to abate human errors in manual processes. 
The expedited process with this tool is calculated to be 5-6 times faster than the usual workflow.

A comparison was also made between experienced and amateur users, resulting in similar usage
times and establishing the didactic nature of the LIT toolkit. The interactive interface 
allows users with limited 3D Modeling and computational abilities to perform daylight analysis 
and generate reports according to LEED criteria with ease.
